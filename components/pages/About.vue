    h2 Our Vision
    p To redefine how Gen Z and Millennial's consume and interact with sports.

    h2 Our Mission
    p We are on a mission to evolve and enhance the overall experience of watching sports online for Gen Zâ€™s
      | and young Millennial communities. FX1 will grow viewership by enabling them to connect and engage socially
      | while watching online sports with their friends, while also having the ability to earn income, prizes, and clout.

    h2 What We Do
    p Our product is an interactive live messaging platform that seamlessly integrates and enhances the streamed sports
      | game day experience, making it easier for fans to connect and engage socially while watching sports online.

    p Fans will be able to browse all their streamed sports platforms in one place, watch live sports online, chat
      | with friends anywhere, and earn rewards and prizes while watching sports.

    p FX1 will partner with streaming platforms, sporting leagues, and media rights holders. Our platform complements
      | and enhances the online experience for its customers.

    p Unlike the current streaming platforms that offer streamed content to customers in return for a fee, FX1 leverages
      | this streamed content by overlaying it with proprietary-built technology that further enhances the experience.

    p FX1 Pty Ltd is an Australian-owned company. It also owns FIT3 LLC, which represents the
      | North American arm of FX1. Our North American team is based out of California and supports
      | FX1 across product development, sales, and marketing.
